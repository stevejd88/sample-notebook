          <strong>How do I use an Engineering Notebook?</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1.</strong>{" "}
            <strong>
              Mistakes are an important part of the Engineering and Learning
              processes, they should be embraced and celebrated!
            </strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.</strong> Document NEATLY.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.</strong> Document EVERYTHING AS IT HAPPENS.
            <p>
              <strong>-</strong>If it is not documented or written the next day,
              it did not happen.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.</strong> Entries should include enough information so
            someone else could successfully duplicate your work.
            <p>
              <strong>-</strong>Label figures and sketches. Keep sketches
              up-to-date â€“ make changes as they happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>-</strong>Use complete sentences. Sentences begin with
              capitalization and end with punctuation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5.</strong> Once completed, sign and date each page, unused
            pages should be 'X'ed out and signed as well.
